Vertical Comparator Interface

This small GUI has been created for communication with PLC Lenze.
It controls the carriage moving up and down with regular stops used to make some measurements on land surveyors' equipment.
It is pre-prepared for communication with digital Level and interferometer controlling the actual high precision position of the carriage.
